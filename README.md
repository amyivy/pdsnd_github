### Bikeshare Python Project


### Description
The program allows users to perform various statistical analysis on a specifically formatted dataset from Bikeshare. Users input Month and Day filters to limit the analysis to a specified time period. Users also have a choice to see the raw data.

### Getting Started
To get started download the bikeshare_2.py file and create a test dataset using the following format.
chicago.csv with the columns:
* ID - integer
* Start Time - date and time
* End Time - date and time
* Trip Duration - integer
* Start Station -  text
* End Station - text 
* User Type - text
* Gender - text 
* Birth Year - integer

Run bikeshare_2.py and follow along with the prompts. It's that simple!

### Files used
The following data files were used to perform all statistical analysis. All files were provided by Udacity.
* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
